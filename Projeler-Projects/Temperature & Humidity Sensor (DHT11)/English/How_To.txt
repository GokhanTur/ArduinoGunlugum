TEMPERATURE & HUMIDITY SENSOR (DHT11) - How To

This project reads temperature data using a DHT11 sensor and displays the result via the serial monitor.

💡 Required Materials:
- Arduino Uno or compatible
- 1 × DHT11 sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- USB cable

🔌 Circuit Connections:
- Connect the VCC pin of the DHT11 to 5V on Arduino.
- Connect the GND pin of the DHT11 to GND on Arduino.
- Connect the DATA pin of the DHT11 to digital pin 2.

🖥️ Steps:
1. Install the "DHT sensor library" and "Adafruit Unified Sensor" via Library Manager in Arduino IDE.
2. Open Arduino IDE and connect your Arduino.
3. Paste the code into the IDE.
4. Upload the code.
5. Open the Serial Monitor to see the temperature and humidity readings.

LED BLINK PROJECT - How To

This project will make an LED connected to an Arduino board blink continuously. The LED will turn on for one second, then turn off for one second in a loop.

üí° Required Materials:
- 1 √ó Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- 1 √ó LED
- 1 √ó 220 ohm resistor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- USB cable for uploading code

üîå Circuit Connections:
- Connect the long leg (anode) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino.
- Connect the short leg (cathode) of the LED to one end of a 220 ohm resistor.
- Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin on the Arduino.

üñ•Ô∏è Steps:
1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Paste the provided code into the IDE.
4. Click the Upload (‚Üí) button.
5. The LED should blink once every second.

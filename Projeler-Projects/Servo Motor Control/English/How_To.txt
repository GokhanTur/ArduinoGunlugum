SERVO MOTOR CONTROL - How To

This project controls the position of a servo motor using an Arduino. The servo moves between 0° and 180° positions.

💡 Required Materials:
- Arduino Uno or compatible
- 1 × Servo motor (SG90 or similar)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- USB cable

🔌 Circuit Connections:
- Connect the servo's signal wire (usually orange/yellow) to digital pin 9.
- Connect the power wire (red) to 5V.
- Connect the ground wire (brown/black) to GND.

🖥️ Steps:
1. Open Arduino IDE.
2. Go to Tools > Manage Libraries, install the "Servo" library if needed.
3. Paste the code into the IDE.
4. Upload the code.
5. The servo will sweep back and forth automatically.
